# Sets, Dicts, File I/O

## At start

* I'm going to take a bit of a different approach this section to mix things up. It will be a casual, chatty start through which I try to inspire introspective self-confidence to help students see how much they have learned so far...but in a way that leads into sets, dicts, and file I/O.
* I'll start the discussion by asking what type of things have they seen so far: not conditions or loops but objects including ints, floats, bool and None (showing print(type(x)))
* Then, I'll ask about other things that have an "inner life". strings, tuples, lists, sets, dicts and maybe range if nobody mentions it.
* That will lead to my example given below that I work out live, step-by-step.

## Taking attendanceâ€”showing lists, sets, dicts and how they relate

The idea is to figure out the most common letters in our collective names during sectionâ€”a histogram without the figure. Each step is done live and in order of list, set then dict. Asking for student contributions the whole time.

```python
# Take attendance in a list! Use last names too if only a few people. 
names = ['henry', 'dimitri', 'ben', 'nabib', 'julia', 'sammota', 'simeon', 'devon', 'carolyn', 'thomas']

L = list() # show []
S = set()
D = dict() # show {}, talk about contrast with sets

for name in names:
    for letter in name:

        # List approach
        L.append(letter)

        # Unique letters in list without set
        # if letter not in L:
        #     L.append(letter)

        # Set approach Mention hashing, non-ordering
        S.add(letter) #show how append fails and why

        # Dictionary (stress key:value pairs)
        if letter in D:
            D[letter] += 1
        else:
            D[letter] = 1
        
        # Show pythonic one-liner
        D[letter] = D.get(letter, 0) + 1

# Just for fun, maybe I will demonstrate sort and lambda, perhaps after input/output in which they did sorting in Excel?        
for letter in sorted(D, key=lambda letter: D[letter], reverse=True):
    print(f"{letter}: {D[letter]}")
        
# print(D) # to show what dict looks like (or do in python tutor)
```

## File I/O

* I'll then demo how to write the output of line 48 above to a txt file basically with the following lines instead, and maybe not with sorted if I want to show how to sort in Excel to motivate the sorting discussionâ€”I'll play that by ear.

```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as output:

    for letter in sorted(D, key=lambda letter: D[letter], reverse=True):
        output.write(f"{letter},{D[letter]}\n")
```

* I'll then demo how to read input from a txt file. Perhaps I'll write the names of the people in section into the file. I'll show the difference between .read(), .readline(), and .readlines()

```python
with open("pset4.txt", "r") as file:
    
    names = file.read() #demo readline() and readlines()
    print(names)
```

## Big breakout session

* Finally, I'll turn it over to students to work in an extended breakout session in which they find the most common letters in the pset 4 spec! A prepared file can be found here: https://gist.github.com/ThomasBallatore/ff3d5f4ee5de0b1e4b9b2d888915f511 Let's not worry about special characters, etc. The point is there are a lot of spaces, e's and a's and one & ðŸ˜‚
